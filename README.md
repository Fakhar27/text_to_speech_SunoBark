Bark TTS Implementation for Reel Generator
Overview
Implementation of Suno's Bark text-to-speech model optimized for Google Colab T4 GPU. Features include long-form text generation, optimized performance, and voice preset support.
Features

Half-precision (float16) optimization
BetterTransformer support
Long text handling via smart chunking
Voice preset compatibility
GPU memory management
Progress tracking
~1.5 minutes generation time for 24 seconds of audio

Requirements
Copytransformers
torch
scipy
optimum (optional, for BetterTransformer)
Hardware Requirements

GPU: Google Colab T4 (tested)
VRAM: 16GB
Runtime: GPU-enabled Colab instance

Performance Metrics

Generation Speed: ~1.5 minutes per 24 seconds of audio
Text Chunk Size: 13-15 seconds per chunk
Memory Usage: Optimized for 16GB VRAM

Core Features Implementation
Text Processing

Smart chunking for long texts
Automatic sentence boundary detection
Configurable silence between chunks

Optimizations
pythonCopymodel = BarkModel.from_pretrained(
    "suno/bark",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
).to(device)

Half-precision computation
GPU memory clearing between chunks
Proper attention mask handling

Voice Control

Support for all Bark voice presets
Consistent voice across chunks
Configurable silence duration

Usage
Basic Usage
pythonCopybark = ImprovedBark()
audio = bark.generate_audio(
    text="Your long text here",
    voice_preset="v2/en_speaker_6",
    silence_duration=0.5
)
Long Text Generation
pythonCopystory = """
Your long story or text content here...
"""
audio = bark.generate_audio(story)
bark.save_audio(audio, "output.wav")
Known Limitations

13-15 second chunk limit
Requires GPU for reasonable performance
Memory intensive for very long texts
Occasional attention mask warnings
